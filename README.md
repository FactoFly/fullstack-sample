# Factofly Fullstack Sample Tasks
## Project: Pokemon Manager API

### Requirements üí°
- **Frontend framework**: ReactJS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Language**: TypeScript (Node.js)
- **Backend framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) & [Prisma (ORM)](https://www.prisma.io/)

### Notes üìù
The scope of this sample project comes in two parts:

1. Convert the designs to a Frontend template
2. Handle Pokemon data and expose routes that let clients interact with it in the way that is discribed below.

The orginal Pokemon data is found at [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2)

### Tasks ‚úÖ
- Create an API which will have the following features:
  - Basic authentication (You need to be logged in to add/edit/delete)
  - A list of paginated Pokemons (each item should contain: name, height, weight and image). The result should be:
    - sortable by name, height and weight;
    - filterable by name, height range and weight range.
  - The pagination should allow the clients to choose how many items are displayed on a page. Allowed values: 10, 20 and 50;
  - Ability to add/edit/delete custom Pokemons.
- Bonus points:
  - Use GraphQL instead of REST endpoints

### Submitting üöÄ
Upload your project to your Git & include the url of the repository in your application. Remember that the repository must be public!

### Designs ‚úèÔ∏è
